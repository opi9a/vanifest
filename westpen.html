<h2>Camping spots</h2>
<div id="Trevadra Farm Caravan and Camping" dir="ltr">
	<h3>C1:  Levant cliff-top wild spot</h3>
	<p>Glorious isolated and atmospheric wild spot, with full sea views
	and wild winds.  Take binoculars to watch companies of gannets going
	to and from work.</p>
	<p>Near Levant Mine and Beam Engine (National Trust), TR19 7SX. 
	(Was in Poldark).</p>
	<p>Narrow access lane: drive carefully past NT car park and turn
	left along a boulder avenue onto clifftop platform. 
	</p>
	<p>Price:  $0.00 + VAT</p>
	<p>Arrive after 5pm when NT centre has closed.   NT car park people
	have always been fine when leaving the next day (give them a wave).</p>
	<h3><a name="Trevadra Farm Caravan and Camping"></a>C2:  Trevadra
	Farm Caravan and Camping</h3>
</div>
<p>Full-facility caravan and camping site, near a beach and a pub. 
Good for a dose of civilisation, and beach lounging etc.  Quite
commercial but still tolerably pleasant and a handy option.</p>
<p>Near Sennen,  TR19 7BE</p>
<p>01736 871818 – worth ringing ahead too check they have space.</p>
<p>Pricey: £20-30 per night (total) 
</p>
<div id="Treverven Touring Park" dir="ltr">
	<h3><a name="Treverven Touring Park"></a>C3:  Treverven Touring Park</h3>
</div>
<p>Cliff-top campsite, bright, breezy and open.  Quite large, can be
busy but lots of room and good facilities (incl laundry and chemical
disposal), nice aspect and position.  Good when you want to stay
somewhere for a few days – especially if you get a good pitch.</p>
<p>St Buryan TR19 6DL</p>
<p>£15-19 per night without hookup</p>
<p>Good facilities. 
</p>
<p>The best spots are all the way to left as you enter, immediately
up against the road – has the best views and max shelter from
prevailing westerlies.</p>
<div id="Flushing Toilet campsite (aka &quot;Morvah camping field&quot;)" dir="ltr">
	<h3><a name="Flushing Toilet campsite (aka &quot;Morvah camping field&quot;)"></a>
	C4:  Flushing Toilet Campsite (aka &quot;Morvah camping field&quot;)</h3>
</div>
<p>Basic, but with running water and the eponymous flushing toilets –
and good open views (can just about see the sea).   Nice and cheap
and relaxed – can just pitch up at the end of the day.  But also
has a wild, non-commercial feel.</p>
<p>Price: around £5 per night, cash payment to farmer / family. 
</p>
<p>Avoid parking by windmill which can be noisy. Open fires. Rough
and ready.  Good chance of meeting interesting travellers and
pilgrims.</p>
<p>Walkable to North Inn pub with food (curry) in Pendeen (see
below).</p>
<div id="Trerise Farm" dir="ltr">
	<h3><a name="Trerise Farm"></a>C5:  Trerise Farm</h3>
</div>
<p>Good base for exploring the Lizard – quite a different area to
West Penwith.  The general area can be pretty busy but this site is
(or was) extremely quiet and a good place to escape the crowds.  It’s
huge and open, with good views and atmosphere. Good basic washing
facilities etc though no shop, laundry etc. 
</p>
<p>We had a whole (huge) field to ourselves.  New family-run business
– may get busier.</p>
<p>Near Helston, Lizard TR12 7NA 01326 291269 
</p>
<p>No booking (but not required).</p>
<p>Price: ~£7,  cash collection.</p>
<h2>General facilities and attractions</h2>
<div id="Lizard village" dir="ltr">
	<h3><a name="Lizard village"></a>G1:  Lizard village parking</h3>
	<p>Main spot for exploring the Lizard peninsula, with walks to the
	most southerly point on the UK mainland.  Can be pretty busy but in
	a nice bustly way.  No overnight parking :(.</p>
	<p>Famous traditional cornish pasty shop “Ann’s” is a major
	attraction, but we thought the pasties were a bit overpriced and not
	that tasty (though possibly genuinely traditional).</p>
	<p>Apparently the reason cornish pasties are made as they are –
	with the wide crusts – is so the tin miners could hold and eat
	them without getting poisoned by the chemicals they had on their
	hands.</p>
</div>
<div id="Pendeen village" dir="ltr">
	<h3><a name="Pendeen village"></a>G2:  Pendeen village</h3>
</div>
<p>Small village with really useful free public car park with
recycling bins, public toilets and a decent small supermarket
(Costcutter).  
</p>
<p>Near Levant spot – so a good place to stop and straighten up
after a wild night on the cliff.</p>
<p>The North Inn in the village serves curry.  Not tried but menu
looked good. Can walk to lighthouse.</p>
<div id="Gurnard's Head hotel" dir="ltr">
	<h3><a name="Gurnard's Head hotel"></a>G4: Gurnard's Head hotel</h3>
</div>
<p>Zennor TR26 3DE</p>
<p>Posh pub / restaurant / hotel - good for a special meal.</p>
<h3>G5: Bosigran</h3>
<p>Wild spot on north coast – and the major climbing location in
West Penwith.  Good for a cliff walk, with great views and possible
picnic sites.</p>
<p>Park for free by cool ruined tin mine (possible van spot, but busy
and used as toilet - no facilities). Walk to coast path, with views
of climbing cliff (in front), and Commando Ridge on left. 
</p>
<h3>G6: Penzance LIDL</h3>
<p>TR18 4NP Large LIDL with ample parking
